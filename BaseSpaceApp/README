# Instructions to create the BaseSpace app

# Get source code, but as you're reading this you must already have done it
git clone https://github.com/Illumina/agg.git
cd agg
git checkout basespace

# Compile agg
make

# Prepare app files
cd BaseSpaceApp
mkdir agg
cp ../agg ../make_chunk.py bsAppScript.sh agg/

# Create app (internal tool for the moment, ask ljanin)
bs-create-native-app app_agg.json



Notes:
- The app is called "AutomaticallyGeneratedApp". I leave this as it is until we are happy to make it public.
- The app is created for basespaceuser2 account on Hoth server
